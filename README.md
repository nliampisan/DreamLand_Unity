# DreamLand_Unity

This is a first person shooter game created by Unity 5. In the game you are stuck in Dreamland and you can only roam on
the plane or else you go falling endlessly down. The objective is to score as many points as possible before the dream time
expires. To score points you need to fire a magical laser at the cubes. The yellow cubes gives you 10 points , while the red cubes
gives you -5 points. The other cubes do not add or subtract points. To extend the dream time you have to physically touch the
floating purple cube and it will give you an extra 10 seconds. 

The normal fps controls apply. WASD or arrow keys for movement. Left Mouse to fire laser. Space to jump. 

You can see screenshots of the game in the screenshots folder.
